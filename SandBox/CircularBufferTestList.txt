= CircularBuffer Test List =

== Design ==
 * FIFO
  * fixed size, 10 ints
  * pointer to start, end
 * Store int
 
== Interface ==
 * Create() 	- initialize an empty circular buffer
 * Destroy() 	- delete all memory associated with buffer
 * IsEmpty() 	- return true if circular buffer is empty or uninitialized 
 * IsFull() 	- return true if circular buffer is full
 * Queue()		- write element in the available slot at the tail
 * Dequeue()	- read first element, return through pointer if not NULL, free slot, return false if it fails
 * Size()		- return the size of the circular buffer
 * Print()		- print the contents of the circular buffer

== Test List ==
 1. is empty after being initialized
 1. write 1 element makes it not empty
 1. write 1 then read 1 makes it empty
 1. write N elements in empty buffer fills buffer
 1. write N+1 elements in empty buffer fails
 1. write 1 element after full returns error
 1. fill buffer, delete first, insert new (tests wraparound)
 1. fail to create 0 dimension buffer
 1. create a zero length buffer
 
== Test Procedure ==
 * Choose tests that check the initial state and explore its interface. 
 * Only choose tests that can pass with hard-coded return results.
